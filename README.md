# Hobogrid

Hey there! You're probably lost... But don't worry!

Ever found yourself stuck with a bunch of `case class` instances in a list somewhere on the frontend, desperately wishing for an easy way to turn them into a table? Enter Hobogrid, your table-making buddy!

### Laminar

If you are familiar with [Laminar](https://github.com/raquo/Laminar) you can figure out easly, that Hobogrid is mean to be tables for Laminar :) 

## Use Case
So, you're facing the classic `List[CaseClass]` conundrum? You could go all fancy with shapeless for the table-building shenanigans. It's a solid choiceâ€”like bringing a magician to a party.

But, if you're open to an adventure and a little bit of a let's-get-this-done kind of coder, Hobogrid's your coding buddy. Throw your list its way, and it'll cook up a basic HTML table without breaking a sweat.

Concerned about the looks? You should be... tables look ugly. Hobogrid, with a little push, can make it usable (but not right now)
